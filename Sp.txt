Q1280810615 seems suspicious to me. I do not want to accuse anything or casuse drama. But I think offcial QQ and reseller topics should be discuessed. 
1: Before we were promoted to mod, he has already annouced on QQ group that he is a support. The owner of the QQ group is a reseller, and he is a mod in that QQ group.
2: After we became mods, he calimed he got kicked from that QQ group. However, he pined his own QQ group on CN section. Named "Half offcial QQ group". I went in and saw its "The Only L++ CN Offcial QQ", and with that reseller.
3: Before Synx's "beta" announcment on CN section, he told me he have Sprediction. (Im wasn't sure what he want)
4: After I got reports from users saying CN mod is selling Synx's prediction. Which Synx also have got reports from other user saying 1 CN,  mod is selling prediction. And the report was a day after Q1280810615 told me he have prediction.
